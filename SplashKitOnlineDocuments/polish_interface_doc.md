  - Flex-direction adjustments in main columns to stack elements vertically on devices with a max-width of `768px`.

### Canvas Functionality
- Fixed issues with canvas scaling to ensure it maintains the correct aspect ratio across all device orientations and sizes.
- Applied maximum width constraints to prevent the canvas from stretching beyond the intended bounds.

## Testing and Validation
